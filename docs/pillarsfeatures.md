## MST Mining

#### MST Issuer

MST issuer should specify the MST mining subsidy parameters(`--subsidy`) when he issue a MST if he want the MST to be mined.

The format of `--subsidy` parameter is `initial:unit32,interval:unit32,base:float`.

And MST mining reward is calculated byï¼š`initial \* pow(base, (block_height/interval))`.

#### Example

issue:
`./mvs-cli issue testacc testacc MST.MST.TEST -s "initial:300000000,interval:500000,base:0.95"`

MST mining reward = 300000000 \* pow(0.95, (Current block height - Height when MST issued) / 500000).
