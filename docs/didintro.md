# Digital identity (Avatar):

The digital identity is a collective name for the profile information of the account corresponding to the master private key owned by the user. It has a unique identifier in the entire network and is bound to the user's address one by one. Having a digital identity symbolizes a valid identity on the chain through which assets can be held and issued.
Digital identities can be held by a single or multiple registrants, which cannot be forged. When multiple users jointly hold, the multi-signature address created by these users is bound. At this time, the transaction must be issued by multiple people Co-signature confirmation.
A valid digital identity can be transferred between different addresses under the account, or it can be transferred to other accounts indirectly through a multi-signature address transferred to multiple accounts, and the historical address in the process of digital identity migration can be viewed on the chain.
Instead of using an address, you can create a transaction with a digital identity. Transactions created with a digital identity will be verified on the chain. Sending a transaction with an invalid digital identity or sending to an invalid digital identity will be rejected
