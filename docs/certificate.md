## Check your Certificates

You can see your certificates per Avatar in the Avatar main page. There is 3 types of certificates:

1. Secondary Issue: This certificate give you the permission to do a Secondary Issue on a specific Asset. The issuer of an asset automatically get this certificate if the Secondary Issue option has been specified.
2. Domain: This certificate give you the ownership of a domain (i.e. if you own the Domain ‘MVS’, only you can create an asset whose name start with ‘MVS.’). The issuer of an asset automatically get this certificate.
3. Naming: This certificate give you the permission to create an asset for a specific name (i.e. if you own the Naming ‘MVS.ASSET’, you have the permission to create the Asset called ‘MVS.ASSET’ only). It can be created and sent by the Domain owner.
